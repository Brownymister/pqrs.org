You can change the keyboard type (ANSI, ISO, JIS) from Virtual Keyboard tab.

The keyboard type is tied to the country code due to the macOS specification.
And we have to log out to apply the keyboard type changes.

So, we recommend to assign each keyboard types to country code 0,1,2.
And then, choose the country code when you want to change the current keyboard type.

We have to log out after the keyboard type (ANSI, ISO, JIS) is changed to apply the changes.
