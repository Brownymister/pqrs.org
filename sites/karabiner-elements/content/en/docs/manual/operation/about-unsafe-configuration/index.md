There are several settings that cannot be enabled by default in the GUI to prevent improper configuration which breaks macOS operation.

**Although never recommended**, enabling Unsafe Configuration from the Pro tab allows you the following operations.

If you want to enable the unsafe configuration, remember how to [start up your Mac in safe mode](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/start-up-your-mac-in-safe-mode-mh21245/mac).
You can restore the settings in safe mode even if you make a mistake.
